This assignment is taking the Google Books API search engine (RESTful API) and is refractored with GraphQL API and Apollo Server. This app uses the MERN stack (Mongoose [database}, Express [server], React [front end], and Node [server]) to operate. 

* The refractoring required a set up of the Apollo Server with the use of GraphQL along with mutations to fetch and modify data from RESTful API.


This app required several dependecies run: npm run develop and it will be alive!!
