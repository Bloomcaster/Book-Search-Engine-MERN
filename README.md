# Book-Search-Engine-MERN  

This assignment is taking the Google Books API search engine (RESTful API) and is refractored with GraphQL API and Apollo Server. This app uses the MERN stack (Mongoose [database}, Express [server], React [front end], and Node [server]). 

* The refractoring required a set up of the Apollo Server witht the use of GraphQL with mutations to fetch and modify data to replace the existing RESTful API.
* Required modifying existing authentification middleware to work with GraphQL.
* Created an Apollo Provider to allow requests to communicate with the Apollo Server.

This app required several dependecies to run and work please make sure to run: npm run develop so that it will start up.
